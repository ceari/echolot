= Server-Side JavaScript Components =
The Echo Web Application Framework allows creating web applications that are
programmed with Java use the Client-Side components and run in a 
Java servlet container environment. 

This guide will help you to create the java component to use a client-side
JavaScript component. 
 
== Prerequisites ==
* Java language understanding
* The fundamentals are described in the nextapp.echo documentation at 
"http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3/doc/devguide/serverapps"

== Introduction ==
Developing a heterogenic plattform consisting of JavaScript and Java makes sense. 
The Java code will not be exposed to the client and can be trusted and the rendering 
happens right in the browser reducing the network traffic to a minimum.  

To use a client-side component in java you need to develop a minimal Peer for
exchanging sychronization messages between server component and client component.
